    "1. A description of your approach: how you will split up the problem into distinct functions, and what will each function do?\n",
    "I broke the problem down into a main function, a menu function, a choice function for players and a choice function for the computer. The menu function prints out the choices for the player and waits for a response. I then use my choice function for players to continually prompt the user for a valid choice and do not return until I have one. The choice function for the computer takes in a dictionary with the keys being \"rock, paper or scissors\" and the associated values with those keys are counters for how many times the user picks each one. The computer picks the most used choice by the user and then returns the choice that will beat it. The main function has a while loop that runs until the user enters quit. Inside the loop I do all the checking to see which player won. I make calls to the other functions within the main while loop to reuse code.\n",
